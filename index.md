By no means am I an expert. I will never claim to be one, but that should not stop me from learning.

You can find supplemental resources that I have written on topics of my interests under the [GUIDES](/guides) directory.
Anyone is more than welcome to use, modify, or distribute as desired; my only desire is to know that I can help anyone
who also shares my interests understand or reinforce what they know of.

As I mentioned, I am no expert in my field nor interests, but I have a desire to research questions that arise in my
head. These questions may, and most likely already, have been answered, but all papers under the [PAPERS](/papers)
directory are of my own interpretation written through my own words.

Lastly, any personal and/or public projects that I have worked on can be found under the [PROJECTS](/projects)
directory. I have provided a link to the repo, if applicable, and a description of the project per entry.
