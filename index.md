### Preamble --

By no means am I an expert. I will never claim to be one, but that should not stop me from wanting to learn and teach
those who care to listen to me.

### Site Structure --

* You can find supplemental resources that I have written on topics of my interests under the [GUIDES](/guides)
directory. Anyone is more than welcome to use, modify, or distribute as desired; I just hope that I can be of any help
for anyone.

* I like to question, think them through, and write them down for reference. You can find these written references as
papers under the [PAPERS](/papers) directory, written through my own words.

* Lastly, any personal and/or public projects that I have worked on can be found under the [PROJECTS](/projects)
directory. A description of the project and a link to its repo are also provided per project.

### Contact Me --

You can find me on networking sites by clicking through the images found at the bottom of all pages.
